# 0CC-FamiTracker
This is a modified version of FamiTracker that incorporates various new effects and bug fixes which work in exported NSFs as well. The name "0CC" comes from the author's favourite arpeggio effect. The current version includes:

 - Complete Sunsoft 5B support
 - Arpeggio schemes
 - Hardware volume envelopes
 - Find / replace tab
 - Detune settings
 - Groove settings
 - Echo buffer access
 - Delayed channel effects
 - N163 wave buffer access effect
 - Expansion chip selector & ad-doc multichip NSF export

The current build is based on the 0.4.6 official release of FamiTracker and the 2.11 version of the NSF driver; 0CC-FamiTracker will continue to use that version in future updates unless there is great need for update, but its behaviour may not be identical if and when any of the features of this mod becomes part of the an official FamiTracker release.

0CC-FamiTracker accepts feature requests and bug reports at the official development log at http://0cc-famitracker.tumblr.com/ as well as the forum at http://hertzdevil.info/forum/ where users may also share their 0CC-FT creations.
