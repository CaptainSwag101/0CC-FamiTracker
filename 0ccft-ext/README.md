# 0ccft-ext

Test folder for building 0CC-FamiTracker's core components directly in a
cross-platform manner. Currently it does the following things:

- Creates an empty module using the 2A03 chip;
- Loads [Kraid's Hideout (NES)][kraid] into the module;
- Exports an NSF file from the module;
- Exports a JSON file from the module;
- Saves the module into a .0cc file.
